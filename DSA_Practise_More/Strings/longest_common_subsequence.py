# Longest Common Subsequence
# Difficulty: Medium 

# Given two strings s1 and s2, return the length of their longest common subsequence (LCS). 
# If there is no common subsequence, return 0.

# A subsequence is a sequence that can be derived from the given string by deleting some or 
# no elements without changing the order of the remaining elements. For example, "ABE" 
# is a subsequence of "ABCDE".

# Examples:

# Input: s1 = "ABCDGH", s2 = "AEDFHR"
# Output: 3
# Explanation: The longest common subsequence of "ABCDGH" and "AEDFHR" is "ADH", which has a length of 3.

# Input: s1 = "ABC", s2 = "AC"
# Output: 2
# Explanation: The longest common subsequence of "ABC" and "AC" is "AC", which has a length of 2.

# Input: s1 = "XYZW", s2 = "XYWZ"
# Output: 3
# Explanation: The longest common subsequences of "XYZW" and "XYWZ" are "XYZ" and "XYW", both of length 3.

# Constraints:
# 1<= s1.size(), s2.size() <=103
# Both strings s1 and s2 contain only uppercase English letters.

class Solution:
    def LCS(self, s1:str, s2:str) -> int:
        n, m  = len(s1), len(s2)
        dp = [[0] * (m+1) for x in range(n+1)]

        for i in range(1, n+1):
            for j in range(1, m+1):
                if s1[i-1] == s2[j-1]:
                    dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j-1]+1
                else:
                    dp[i][j] = max(dp[i][j-1], dp[i-1][j])
        return dp[n][m]
